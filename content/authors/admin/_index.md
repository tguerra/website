I am a PhD Candidate at Sciences Po Grenoble, University of Grenoble-Alpes. I graduated from Sciences Po Grenoble and formerly I was Visiting Student Research Collaborator in 2017 at Princeton University.

My main research interests lie in the field of public opinion comprising mainly questions on mass polarization.  
My dissertation focuses on political polarization in Western Europe on economic and cultural issues. My areas of interest span across the fields of political sociology – social class, political attitudes, and political conflict – political psychology and comparative politics— voting behaviour, populist attitudes among the citizenry ; with a regional focus on Western Europe.

I am eager to integrate a range of research methods in my research such as time-series-cross-section analysis (TSCS), quantitative analysis in general and also survey experiments.
